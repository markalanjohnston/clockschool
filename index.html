                <h3>Make Life A Little Easier <i class="fa-solid fa-universal-access"></i></h3>
                <p>
                    The Clock.School App is an innovative tool that has been designed to make the lives of students,
                    teachers, and admin
                    easier by helping them keep track of class time and stay on schedule throughout the school day.
                    The app also makes the school bell schedule available to any device with internet access, so you
                    can use your phone, computer, or smart tv to dispalay the current class period time remaining!
                </p>
                <h3>Increases Productivity <i class="fa-solid fa-bolt"></i></h3>
                <p>
                    One of the primary benefits of the Clock.School App is that it helps encourage "bell to bell"
                    instruction. The app helps ensure that every minute of each class period is utilized
                    effectively,
                    and that students and teachers are engaged in learning activities from the beginning of class to
                    the end. The Clock.School App helps teachers avoid wasted time in class, which helps to maximize
                    learning time and improve overall academic outcomes.
